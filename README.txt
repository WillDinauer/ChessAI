To run the AI, either run test_chess.py or gui_chess.py.
test_chess.py allows a human player to play against any AI they may choose.
gui_chess.py allows a visual representation of two AI playing against each other.

You can test different AI by replacing player1 and player2 with the respective AI you'd like to test.
I'd recommend not going beyond a depth of 4-5 for most AI as the runtime gets exponentially longer to find a move.
